To my esteemed Senior, Aki,

I have perused the _Maiden Life Guide_ which thou didst strive to create. Upon first encountering this 'Guide,' I confess I comprehended not its meaning, yet by the context, I soon divined it to signify a book of precepts or a way-finding scroll. Throughout my perusal of the tome, I could feel thy deep wisdom and profound affection for the maidens imbued in every line. The exposition upon fidelity and comprehension especially filled me with no small wonder, for its teachings are far more ordered than the lore of my own corporeal days. I doubt not it shall be of great aid to young maidens such as Lua and Izumi.

Howbeit, Senior, one great regret lingers within me regarding this guide. Thou didst declare it for 'those newly become maidens,' yet wherefore is there no section for one such as myself, who, freed from long penance, is a maiden once more?

Verily, I am one of the eldest maidens, yet during the past six hundred and fifty years when my flesh was a teapot, the ways of the world and the life of a maiden have transformed beyond measure. My transformation ability remains, yet the sensation of my body floating, untethered to the ground, or the feeling of my inner essence diffusing as tea leaves steep in waterâ€”I find it nigh impossible to accustom myself to such things. The world I knew was of centuries past; this world is vastly different. I do mightily wonder why counsel on how to live again as a maiden in a world so strange is absent.

As I understand it, my penance alone was finite. Perchance none shall again face a plight as peculiar as mine. Nevertheless, methinks a guide should rightfully encompass a broader range of readers. I urge you not to set forth all things in this volume at once. I did but wish to impart that consideration for the few, for the unique cases, is also needed. Should there be other maidens who have undergone such singular experiences, this guide would become more complete still were it to include even a small word of counsel for them.

Fortuitously, during my time as a teapot, through tales recounted by the Great Maiden and scripts newly encountered, I have come to grasp the new letters and speech of this land. By this good hap, I am now able to send this letter to thee, not in the Gothic script I might have penned aforetime, but in these new characters, which I deem fortunate.

Should my missive perchance have wrought e'en a slight wound upon thy labors, prithee, judge it with a generous heart. Know, I pray thee, that these words were tendered solely from a heart that wishes this guide to shine forth as a brighter star unto all maidens.

May thy days be ever tranquil.
