<p>When Lua returned from her drive and greeted the Great Maiden, the
Great Maiden motioned for her to sit. The letter Hinata had brought lay
on the table before her. As Lua sat, the Great Maiden spoke in a low but
firm voice.</p>
<p>“Lua, the great tides of the world have begun to reach our
shrine.”</p>
<p>Lua saw the Great Maiden’s gaze linger on the letter. She
instinctively felt this was connected to her meeting with Sayuri and the
period of great turmoil she had heard about at the Shrine of Time.</p>
<p>“This is a proposal for a large-scale apartment development in the
area.”</p>
<p>At the Great Maiden’s words, Lua’s eyes widened in surprise.
Apartment development—the words felt utterly alien to this sacred and
tranquil mountain.</p>
<p>“According to the plan, this entire mountain will be transformed into
a massive apartment complex. And our shrine… is located right in the
center of the development site.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden pointed to a blueprint in the letter. Lua could see
for herself that the shrine’s location was squarely in the middle of the
development plan.</p>
<p>“That’s why the construction company contacted us about land
compensation.”</p>
<p>Lua was confused. “Great Maiden… the shrine is registered as land?
But we are spiritual beings, and the shrine is just… like a part of our
bodies, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden nodded. “It is. But one must abide by the rules of
the world. For the shrine to maintain its existence, it must have a
tangible presence within the world’s legal framework.”</p>
<p>She calmly continued her explanation. “For a very long time, this
shrine has been legally registered to a succession of maidens—those who
were wise by the world’s standards but not yet physically old. Since my
own existence as the shrine’s true form cannot be revealed, we needed a
public face.”</p>
<p>Finally, it all made sense to Lua. It was a wise method devised by
her predecessors, allowing them to exist within the world’s legal system
while protecting the shrine’s secrets.</p>
<p>“Until now, Shizuku-san has filled that role. However, this matter is
likely to escalate beyond simple compensation negotiations. And… you,
Lua, are next in line.”</p>
<p>At the Great Maiden’s words, Lua’s heart pounded. After Shizuku, it
was her turn to become the shrine’s legal owner and face the outside
world. The immense responsibility of protecting the shrine from the
colossal wave of development weighed heavily on her shoulders.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Lua instinctively knew what she had to do. To
protect the shrine from this massive wave, she desperately needed the
help of an expert from the outside world—someone who could read and
navigate the currents of modern society.</p>
<p>Lua sprang to her feet. The face of one person rose clearly in her
mind.</p>
<p>‘Hasegawa-san…’</p>
<p>She immediately began rummaging through her pockets, searching for
the contact information they had exchanged when she last parted ways
with
Sayuri.<a href="prompts.html#6:1" class="comment-marker">[6:1]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Lua found Sayuri’s contact information, but the question now was how
to reach her. Just then, Aki, who was standing nearby, seemed to read
Lua’s mind and sent a telepathic message.</p>
<p>“Lua, I’ll help. How about I transform?”</p>
<p>Aki’s body glowed, and she morphed into a sleek, state-of-the-art
smartphone. Marveling at the perfect transformation, Lua held the
phone—Aki’s body—in her hand. Sayuri’s name appeared clearly on the
touch screen. Lua pressed the call button without hesitation.</p>
<p>After a few rings, Sayuri’s voice came through.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>Lua calmly began to explain the situation: the apartment development
plan, the shrine’s land compensation issue, and the fact that she was
now responsible for handling it. A desperation to save the shrine was
evident in her voice.</p>
<p>Sayuri held her breath as she listened. The events of the past
flashed through her mind like a panorama: the sudden goodbye ten years
ago, Lua transforming into a car, the incredible powers she had
witnessed. And now, she felt in her gut that all of it had been leading
to this very moment.</p>
<p>‘So… the Great Maiden brought Yui-chan and me together again for a
reason. Perhaps… for this very moment.’</p>
<p>A strange thrill and an ineffable sense of mystery washed over her.
She realized her presence here wasn’t mere coincidence; she was placed
within a great current of destiny. Yui’s disappearance and their
reunion—everything was connected, leading to now.</p>
<p>“Yui-chan… I get it. Why you disappeared, and why you still look the
same… it all makes sense now.”</p>
<p>Sayuri’s voice trembled, but it held a firm resolve.</p>
<p>“I swear, I will keep your secret. And as for this… I will do
everything in my power to help. Just tell me what you need.”</p>
<p>Lua felt a wave of relief at Sayuri’s sincere words. She sent a
telepathic thank you to Aki. The Great Maiden’s prediction that Sayuri
would become a crucial ally to the shrine was coming true.</p>
<hr />
<p>This wasn’t a problem that could be solved by simply refusing
compensation. The large construction company would surely mobilize its
vast capital and legal teams to pressure the shrine. To win this fight,
they had to find their opponent’s weakness—their ‘Achilles’ heel’.</p>
<p>Under the Great Maiden’s direction, the maidens began using their
unique abilities to uncover the construction company’s corruption.</p>
<p>Miho scoured every ancient text and document in the shrine’s library,
searching for historical precedents and legal loopholes. She became the
bookshelf itself, rapidly extracting knowledge from the flow of
countless pieces of information.</p>
<p>Aki reverted from her smartphone form to her native electronic form
and connected to the world’s complex networks. She began investigating
the company’s financials, past projects, and illegal activities. From
financial statements and contracts to unofficial information on key
personnel, her abilities combed through every byte of data in the
digital world.</p>
<p>Izumi, being the smallest, prepared to infiltrate secure locations by
transforming into a data storage device or memory card, completely
unseen. She could slip through the tiniest cracks to acquire the data
they needed.</p>
<p>Lua, in turn, gathered external information through her contact with
Sayuri and began to coordinate the findings of the maidens, assembling
the complete picture. The corporeal maidens had mobilized their full
power, beginning an invisible war. The prelude to a colossal battle for
the shrine’s very existence had
begun.<a href="prompts.html#6:2" class="comment-marker">[6:2]</a></p>
<p>As the maidens’ investigation progressed, the ugly truths hidden
behind the glamorous facade of ‘XX Construction Company’ came to light.
Thanks to Aki’s all-encompassing digital search and Izumi’s stealthy
information retrieval, the company’s internal affairs were laid
bare.</p>
<p>The financial statements Aki uncovered were shocking. XX Construction
appeared to have grown remarkably over the past few years, but it was a
dangerous gamble built on reckless project bids and excessive borrowing.
They had expanded by winning large-scale national and international
projects, but their profitability was in a nosedive due to unexpected
rises in raw material costs and construction delays.</p>
<p>It was a cycle of debt. The company’s cash flow had long since dried
up, and it was barely staying afloat on bank loans and private bonds.
Its financial health was beyond critical; it was teetering on the verge
of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>“Their books are cooked to look good, but in reality, their equity
has been almost entirely wiped out. One bad quarter and they could go
under,” Aki’s telepathic report was clinical.</p>
<p>This forest apartment development was their desperate, last-ditch
effort to hit the jackpot. It was an attempt to erase their massive
debts and revive the company. The shrine was their last lifeline.</p>
<p>Financial desperation had led them to resort to dirty tactics. The
information the maidens uncovered went beyond financial mismanagement;
the company was mired in various illegal activities.</p>
<p>First were the unfair practices against their subcontractors. They
would win bids with absurdly low prices, then pass the costs onto
subcontractors and delay payments to secure a profit. Countless smaller
firms had been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy as a result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their violation of environmental laws was severe. The
maidens found evidence of illegal waste dumping, pollutant discharge,
and even attempts to manipulate environmental impact assessments—all
desperate measures to cut costs.</p>
<p>The internal documents Izumi secretly acquired revealed something
even more shocking: records of large bribes paid to public officials for
permits and illegal donations to politicians. There were also traces of
collusion to monopolize certain projects. They cast a dark shadow,
shamelessly trampling law and ethics for their own gain.</p>
<p>A grim determination settled on the faces of the maidens as they
reviewed the information. Their opponent was a reputable corporation on
the surface, but it was rotten to the core. As long as they held this
colossal secret, there was definitely a way to protect the
shrine.<a href="prompts.html#6:3" class="comment-marker">[6:3]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Holding the information from the shrine, Sayuri’s heart pounded in
her chest. This was more than a scoop. This was a righteous battle that
fueled her mission as a journalist—to expose the corruption of a
corporate giant and help the oppressed. She cut back on sleep, analyzing
the data and writing her story. She dug into the hidden meaning of the
financial statements from Aki, traced the money in the bribery ledger
from Izumi, and used the legal precedents from Miho as the core of her
article.</p>
<p>Finally, Sayuri’s story was published.</p>
<p>[Exclusive] XX Construction’s ‘Golden Goose’ Forest Development Hides
Mountains of Debt, Allegations of Corruption<br />
- Exposé on Reckless ‘All-or-Nothing’ Gamble Amidst Bankruptcy
Crisis<br />
- Squeezing Subcontractors, Environmental Violations, Evidence of
High-Level Bribery… ‘Dark Connection’ Allegations Explode</p>
<p>The article had an explosive impact. Sayuri hadn’t just reported on a
single plot of land; she had exposed a massive knot of corruption
involving XX Construction’s reckless projects, financial decline, unfair
labor practices, environmental crimes, and political lobbying. Her story
shook the media, sparked public outrage, and led to a chorus of demands
for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The article’s real-world repercussions were swift. Facing public
fury, government authorities turned their blades on XX Construction. The
apartment project was halted indefinitely, accompanied by a public
apology. The massive, now-frozen investment choked the company’s last
breath. Under the subsequent prosecutorial investigation and pressure
from financial regulators, the company’s hidden debts and crimes were
revealed one by one. Officials and politicians implicated in the
lobbying scandal were arrested, and the company’s credibility hit rock
bottom.</p>
<p>In just one month, XX Construction, once a titan of the industry,
collapsed completely. Unable to manage its debts, the company declared
bankruptcy. Countless employees lost their jobs, and its stock became
worthless paper. Their gamble for a massive payout had consumed
them.</p>
<p>With XX Construction bankrupt, all of its assets went to auction,
including the vast forest surrounding the shrine. Under the Great
Maiden’s instruction, Lua participated. Just as Shizuku had before her,
Lua now acted as the shrine’s legal owner and its liaison with the
outside world.</p>
<p>With Aki’s precise intelligence and Sayuri’s advice, Lua acquired the
forest land at the perfect moment for the lowest possible price. As it
was a fire sale from bankruptcy, she was able to purchase the vast lands
surrounding the shrine for an astonishingly low sum. Not only was the
shrine now completely free from material threats, but it had also
expanded its domain.</p>
<p>And so, the incident came to a close. As the Great Maiden had
foreseen, Sayuri had been a great help, and through the combined efforts
of the maidens’ powers and Sayuri’s courage, the shrine had turned a
crisis into an opportunity. Lua felt a deep pride in having protected
the shrine’s future with her own hands, along with an even heavier sense
of responsibility. The shrine’s secret remained safe, its quiet
existence continuing deep within the
mountains.<a href="prompts.html#6:4" class="comment-marker">[6:4]</a></p>
<p>With the fall of XX Construction and the successful acquisition of
the forest, Lua was now the official legal representative of the shrine.
A few days later, a simple land transfer ceremony was held deep within
the shrine’s main hall. As the Great Maiden and the other maidens
watched, Shizuku formally transferred the land ownership from her name
to Lua’s.</p>
<p>Taking Lua’s hands, Shizuku said, “Your time has come, Lua. As the
new guardian of this land and this shrine, may you use your wisdom to
its fullest.”</p>
<p>Lua nodded. The legal documents in her hand felt heavier than paper.
They were the weight of the shrine’s long history, its future, and the
lives of all its maidens. She realized her role now extended beyond
transforming and following the Divine’s will; she had to communicate
directly with the outside world to protect her home.</p>
<hr />
<p>That afternoon, a familiar car pulled up to the shrine’s boundary. It
was Sayuri. She stepped out, dressed in a sharp, formal suit. Since her
article’s publication, Sayuri had become a sensation in the press, and
her work had sent shockwaves through society. But more than any joy of
victory, she felt a profound need to thank the people of the shrine who
had trusted her with their incredible secret.</p>
<p>The shrine gate, a transformation of Akari, opened silently. Sayuri’s
gaze immediately found the Great Maiden and Lua standing just inside.
The Great Maiden greeted her with a serene smile, while Lua looked upon
her ‘former girlfriend’ and ‘invaluable ally’ with warmth in her
eyes.</p>
<p>Sayuri walked right up to the boundary line. She bowed respectfully
to the Great Maiden.</p>
<p>“Great Maiden, it is I, Sayuri Hasegawa. Thank you… thank you so much
for everything. Because of you, I was able to bring the truth to light
and help a great many people.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden smiled calmly in return. “It was thanks to your
courage and wisdom, Reporter Sayuri. Without you, the shrine would have
been in grave danger.”</p>
<p>Sayuri then turned her gaze to Lua. The sight of Lua, eternally
unchanging, still filled her with a mix of wonder and a quiet sorrow.
After a moment’s hesitation, she looked back to the Great Maiden and
spoke cautiously.</p>
<p>“Great Maiden… Yui-chan… unlike me, she will live forever, just as
she is now. Please… please take good care of her.”</p>
<p>Her voice was filled with a deep understanding of Yui’s unique
destiny, and the desperate plea of someone entrusting a precious friend
to another’s care. The Great Maiden, seemingly touched by Sayuri’s
sincerity, smiled warmly.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. Yui will receive all the protection and love she
deserves here. In fact, it is we who owe you a great debt. Please…
continue to visit us from time to time. We will need someone to bring us
news of the world, and at times, to lend us aid. We look forward to
working with you.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden’s words were an acknowledgment of Sayuri not as a
mere helper, but as a vital link to the shrine. Lua looked back and
forth between the Great Maiden and Sayuri, her heart swelling with an
inexplicable pride and a sense of anticipation for the future. A new
bridge between the shrine and the outside world had just been
formed.<a href="prompts.html#6:5" class="comment-marker">[6:5]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Before she became a maiden, Yui’s relationship with Sayuri was a
sweet yet poignant first love. They were classmates in the same high
school. Yui was a curious, quirky chatterbox, and Sayuri was the calm
one who would listen quietly to her endless stories, a fond smile on her
face. Different yet similar, they had quickly become the most important
person in the world to each other.</p>
<p>In the summer of their first year, Sayuri worked up the courage to
confess. Despite the scorching heat, her palms were slick with sweat.
“Yui-chan, I… I like you. More than a friend… I like you more.” At her
trembling voice, Yui’s eyes widened in surprise. She felt something
special for Sayuri, too, but the idea of liking another girl was
confusing, and she had no idea where such a relationship could possibly
lead.</p>
<p>But looking into Sayuri’s sincere eyes, Yui’s heart was moved. From
that day on, they were secretly a couple. Their precious, daily routine
consisted of walking hand-in-hand across the empty school grounds after
class, or sitting in a quiet corner of the library, leaning on each
other’s shoulders as they read. The mere presence of the other seemed to
make the whole world shine. They had a vague anxiety about the future,
but they believed their feelings for each other were stronger than
anything.</p>
<p>Their secret romance lasted until the very end of that summer
vacation. A few days before the second semester was to begin, Yui and
Sayuri were sitting on a bench in a small neighborhood park, just as
they always did. Yui was chattering away, and Sayuri was gently toying
with a strand of her hair, listening. It was an ordinary, happy
moment.</p>
<p>Then, an unreadable shadow fell across Yui’s face. She stopped
talking and stared at a distant mountain. “Sayuri… I… I think I have to
go. Suddenly.” Her voice was a mixture of confusion and a strange,
hidden fear. Sayuri, completely bewildered, took her hand. “Go where?
What is it? What’s wrong, Yui-chan?”</p>
<p>But Yui couldn’t say another word. Her gaze grew distant, as if she
were possessed, and her body trembled slightly. “I’m sorry… I’m so, so
sorry, Sayuri.” With those final words, she let go of Sayuri’s hand,
shot up from the bench, and started to run. A stunned Sayuri chased
after her, but Yui vanished from sight in an instant, like smoke.</p>
<p>That was their last meeting. It was a sudden, inexplicable farewell.
Yui disappeared from the world without a trace, leaving Sayuri to begin
a long wait, lost in the confusion and heartbreak of her first love. She
could never forget Yui’s final expression or the sight of the empty sky.
Until she met Yui again ten years later as Lua, Sayuri could neither
understand nor accept what had happened that
day.<a href="prompts.html#6:6" class="comment-marker">[6:6]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Some time after the shrine’s troubles were resolved, Lua suggested a
drive to Sayuri. This was not a mission, but time meant entirely for the
two of them. Lua transformed her body back into the familiar black
electric car, and Sayuri settled into the passenger seat. The car glided
smoothly along a quiet road on the city’s outskirts.</p>
<p>Like the scenery drifting past the windows, their conversation flowed
naturally. They spoke of memories from their school days, of their
dreams, and of everything they had experienced during the ten-year gap.
Sayuri cautiously asked about the changes in Yui’s life since becoming a
maiden, and Yui calmly described her daily life, careful not to betray
the shrine’s secrets. She was still the same chatterbox from all those
years ago, and Sayuri was still her devoted listener.</p>
<p>“You must have been shocked when I suddenly vanished back then,
right?” Yui’s avatar asked with an embarrassed smile.</p>
<p>Sayuri nodded. “Don’t even get me started. You just disappeared
without a trace. Do you have any idea how much I looked for you? I was
sick with worry, thinking you might have left because of me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I’m so sorry, Sayuri. I couldn’t help it back then. It
was all so sudden… being called to the shrine….” The pain of that time
was still evident in Yui’s voice. “Honestly, when we met again, I was
surprised you recognized me… but I was also so happy. I never thought
I’d see you again.”</p>
<p>Sayuri took Yui’s hand. “Me too. You have no idea how bewildered I
was when you showed up looking exactly the same… but I’m so incredibly
glad we can be here and talk like this again.”</p>
<p>As their conversation deepened, Yui felt Sayuri’s presence inside her
‘body’ more vividly than ever. Through the car that was her body, she
sensed Sayuri’s every subtle movement.</p>
<p>“Sayuri, when you’re riding inside me like this…”</p>
<p>Yui’s avatar looked at Sayuri and continued,</p>
<p>“It feels like every single nerve cell in my body is aware of your
presence. The pressure of your back against the passenger seat, the
subtle vibration of the seatbelt on your shoulder, the way your breath
fills the air inside me, the warmth of your hand as it brushes against
my dashboard… I feel all of it.”</p>
<p>She described her sensations in poetic terms.</p>
<p>“When you sit comfortably, my suspension feels like it’s gently
absorbing the road’s impact just to cradle you. When you smile at the
view outside, my whole body feels like it’s sharing that pleasant rush
of air with you. It’s like your very being is a current of energy
flowing through me. So when you’re relaxed and happy, my whole body
feels relaxed and happy, too.”</p>
<p>Yui gave a soft smile.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, it feels like I’m not just a car, but a living space
connected to your senses. When you’re in a good mood, I find myself
wanting to press the accelerator. If you seem bored, I want to guide you
down more interesting roads. Feeling you inside me with my entire body
like this… it’s a truly special experience.”</p>
<p>Sayuri was deeply moved by Yui’s words. The fact that this car was
not just a machine but Yui’s living, feeling body was still a source of
wonder. A strange warmth spread through her, along with a sense of
responsibility, at the thought that her every movement and emotion was
being transmitted to Yui. Feeling each other’s presence in the most
intimate way possible, they continued their drive, healing the wounds of
the past and heading toward a new
future.<a href="prompts.html#6:7" class="comment-marker">[6:7]</a></p>
