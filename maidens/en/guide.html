<p>Hey there! I’m Aki. So, I’m a corporeal maiden born, oh, about 251
years ago. Oops, my age is supposed to be a secret! But hey, once you’ve
lived as long as I have, you’ll figure out that age is just a number
anyway.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons I decided to write this guide. First, I’ve
really felt firsthand that the world ahead is becoming far more complex
than we can imagine, especially for curious and quirky junior maidens
like yourselves. As you know, we learn, know, and experience so much,
but putting it all down clearly in writing is a whole other challenge.
So, I wanted to explicitly lay out our abilities and way of life to help
you gain a broader perspective and deeper understanding. Knowledge is
power, right?</p>
<p>Second, you’ve probably noticed how fast times are changing.
Nowadays, books aren’t just paper ones you flip through by hand; they’re
coming out as e-books, too! (Honestly, it still amazes me!) I’m also
curious about the possibilities new publishing media might hold, and I
wanted to experiment with using it to share our unique maiden knowledge.
Of course, the content in this guide won’t be a perfect answer to every
question. We all need to keep learning and growing, after all.</p>
<p>This booklet will hopefully help you understand the various
situations you’ll face as a maiden a little more easily. I’ve lightly
covered topics like how we become maidens, how our transformation
ability works and what its limits are, what life is like inside and
outside the shrine, and what role we should play in this rapidly
changing world.</p>
<p>So, I hope this book brings a little light to your life as a
maiden!<a href="prompts.html#A:1" class="comment-marker">[A:1]</a></p>
<h2 id="first-steps">First Steps</h2>
<p>If you’re reading this guide, you’ve probably received a special
calling from the Divine. Unless something else happened, of course. For
ordinary humans like we were to be drawn into this shrine, it’s all part
of the Divine’s will.</p>
<p>Our formal name is “the Corporeal Maiden.” This might sound a bit
unfamiliar. That’s because we’re not the only ones in the world. Far
away in other shrines, there are Temporal Maidens who weave the threads
of the future and past, and there’s also the Luminous Maiden, who allows
all of us to read each other’s minds and communicate. I recently learned
for sure through Mai that the Luminous Maiden is a single, unified
being. It feels like she literally encompasses all the light in the
world.</p>
<p>The reason we’re called Corporeal Maidens is simple: we can
manipulate matter in ways people can’t even imagine, and we can even
form our bodies from that matter. You could say we have the ability to
literally “embody” matter. If you want, you can transform into a tiny
leaf or even a huge car. Of course, your comprehension and belief play a
big part in that process.</p>
<p>Thanks to this special ability, we’ve become immortal beings. We
don’t age, we don’t die, and we can live perfectly fine without eating
or sleeping. Sometimes I wonder if we’re truly alive. But despite all
that, we were originally human, right? So if we want to, we still eat
delicious food and sleep in cozy beds. It helps us maintain our
humanity, too.</p>
<p>But here’s the important part: these abilities weren’t given to us
just to use and enjoy as we please. Never forget that all of this was
granted to us by the Divine to maintain the balance of this world.
That’s our very reason for
existing.<a href="prompts.html#A:2" class="comment-marker">[A:2]</a></p>
<h2 id="transformation">Transformation Ability</h2>
<p>Alright, it’s time to dive into our most important ability as
maidens: transformation. You really, really need to get this right.</p>
<p>Within the shrine’s boundary, we can freely transform into anything
we want, whether it’s living or inanimate. And changing back to our
original form is just as easy. But once you go outside the boundary,
it’s a different story. Out there, it’s impossible to transform or
change back. If you need to operate in the outside world, you should
assume you’ll have to leave in an already transformed state.</p>
<p>And this is important: outside the shrine’s boundary, we become
completely naked. What do I mean? Simply put, our clothes and
accessories don’t transform with our bodies or come along with us. So,
the usual method is for maidens to go out in pairs, where one transforms
into the other’s clothes to cover her up. You’ll probably learn this
clothing transformation first when you start practicing.</p>
<p>Our five senses remain the same after transformation. For senses like
sight and hearing, if you’ve transformed into something that covers a
body, like clothes, they’ll be reproduced in a way the person wearing
them would experience. For example, if you become a shoe, you’ll feel
the vibrations and see the world from a shoe’s perspective. If you
transform your entire body into something else, you’ll have a completely
new experience, like perceiving the scenery with your whole being. It
might feel a bit weird at first, but you’ll get used to it quickly, so
don’t worry. If you’ve played any of those popular first-person action
games, you’ll probably adapt easily.</p>
<p>The most crucial aspect of transformation is fidelity. Fidelity
refers to how accurately and essentially perfectly the object you’ve
transformed into is realized. Several factors are important for
fidelity, but there are three main ones. First is the size difference
between your original body and the object you want to become. If you’re
tall and try to turn into something tiny, your fidelity might drop.
Second is how well you understand the object you’re transforming into
(comprehension). And third is your physical condition. If you try to
transform when you’re feeling stiff or tired, your fidelity can drop
significantly, so be careful!</p>
<p>Of these, comprehension is by far the most important. When you’re
just mimicking a static object, like a stone or a wallet, simply
remembering its appearance is usually enough for decent fidelity. But
it’s a different story if you’re transforming into a complex, moving
object like a car. You have to go beyond just its appearance; you need a
detailed understanding of its engine, how all the parts are organically
connected, and you must perceive those parts as if they were your own
body. Only then can you go outside and pass as a proper car without
getting caught. (If you’re curious, go find Lua. She’s a master of car
transformation!) If you force a transformation into a car with low
comprehension, it might move, but it will look bizarre to anyone, like
it’s being dragged along with its wheels locked up. Ultimately, the more
you know about your target, and the deeper your knowledge, the more
faithful and perfect your transformation will be. So, let’s all study
hard!<a href="prompts.html#A:3" class="comment-marker">[A:3]</a></p>
<p>Let me tell you a little more about the transformation ability. When
we transform into something sufficiently large, we can create an avatar
near it. Of course, that avatar can’t be larger than the object you’ve
become, but when you make one, you’ll primarily experience the world
through the avatar’s senses. That’s not to say you lose all sensation in
your original transformed body, so it can be very useful in various
situations.</p>
<p>Maybe some of you junior maidens are scared about what happens if you
get hurt while transformed. Well, to be honest, it’ll really hurt. For
example, if you transform into a glass bead and get shattered, the pain
is surprisingly intense. But don’t panic. As long as you can get most of
those shattered pieces back inside the shrine’s boundary, you can return
to your human form completely, with no marks or injuries. If a terrible
situation like that ever happens, the key is to hold on tight, keep
recalling what your pieces look like, and constantly remind yourself
that all of those pieces are ‘you’ right now. Remember how I said your
comprehension and high-fidelity perception are important? The same
principle applies here. If you can perceive your own shattered state as
‘one complete self,’ you can return to being whole again from that
state.</p>
<p>We can only transform into objects that could physically exist. This
is an important limitation. For example, a car that rolls on its own
without any energy source can’t exist in reality, right? We can’t become
something like that either. In other words, if you transform into a car,
you’ll continuously need fuel. Usually, we can substitute that fuel by
eating. If you run out of fuel while transformed, you’ll probably be
forced back into your human form, which would put you in a real bind, so
it’s best to eat regularly! Honestly, there haven’t been many cases of
us operating as complex, moving objects like this. So, we’ll need more
experimentation and experience in the future. If you discover anything
interesting during your activities, please be sure to let me know!</p>
<p>One last piece of advice: for emergencies, it’s a good idea to have a
way to move yourself at least a little, even if you’re an inanimate
object. For instance, if you become a ball, it would be much more useful
to have a counterweight inside that lets you control the direction you
roll. Without that kind of preparation, you’d have no choice but to hope
other maidens find and help you. Pretty scary thought, isn’t it? There’s
no harm in preparing in advance, so be sure to keep that in
mind.<a href="prompts.html#A:4" class="comment-marker">[A:4]</a></p>
<h2 id="life">Life at the Shrine</h2>
<p>If you’ve entered the shrine, you’ve probably met her. There’s a
maiden who is truly beautiful, and whose words and actions carry a
wisdom that feels ancient—that’s the Great Maiden. To be precise, the
Great Maiden we see is her avatar; in reality, the Great Maiden is the
shrine building itself. She’s the very first maiden of this shrine and
the one who has lived the longest, so if you have a question that other
maidens don’t know the answer to, don’t hesitate to ask her. You’ll
surely find your answer.</p>
<p>Let me tell you more about the maiden attire you’re wearing. This
attire is like a part of your body that only exists within the boundary.
You can slip it off easily, like shedding skin, and if you leave it off,
it will fade away after a moment. If you want to wear it again, just
wish for it strongly in your mind, and it will reappear on your body. As
I mentioned briefly, this attire disappears outside the boundary, so if
you need to go out, make sure to take it off and change into clothes
from the human world while you’re still inside.</p>
<p>As I said before, we have bodies that don’t need food or sleep. We
don’t age or die, after all. Still, maintaining regular meals and sleep,
just like when you were human, is very good for your mental health. A
regular routine helps calm the mind, as you probably know from before
you became a maiden. The dining hall and bedrooms are right next to the
main hall, so feel free to use them.</p>
<p>We maidens can communicate telepathically, all thanks to the Luminous
Maiden. Telepathy always works, no matter where you are—even in an
urgent situation where you have no idea where you are—so don’t worry,
just let us know what’s happening. But there’s one thing to be careful
about: if you send telepathy to too many people at once, you can easily
get a headache. So, getting to know which maidens are good at solving
certain problems will be a huge help in an
emergency.<a href="prompts.html#A:5" class="comment-marker">[A:5]</a></p>
<h2 id="relationship">Relationship with the Outside World</h2>
<p>While we are spiritual beings, we also exist as part of this physical
world. Therefore, it’s crucial to respect the laws of the outside world.
As long as it doesn’t threaten the foundation of our shrine’s existence,
we must not recklessly challenge the world’s order. For example, the
land this shrine sits on has been legally passed down through
generations to a maiden who is wise yet young enough by outside
standards. As of my writing this, Lua is in that role. Someday, one of
you reading this might take on that role, too.</p>
<p>You’ve probably all received your new maiden names by now. While it’s
natural to use your maiden name within the shrine, there will inevitably
be times outside when you have to use the name from your human life.
This might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it’s unavoidable, so we
ask for your understanding. If it’s too difficult or troubling, please
talk to the other maidens in advance. We’ll help you find a solution
together.</p>
<p>We are the ones who maintain the world’s balance, right? So, it’s
extremely important to keep up with how the world is turning. Especially
these days, the tools of modern civilization like televisions,
computers, and mobile phones are essential for understanding the world.
When you need things like that, come to me (Aki), and I’ll transform to
help you out. But don’t use me too much. Unfortunately, I only have one
body.</p>
<p>When you go out into the world, you must be extremely careful not to
let our secret get out. In truth, it probably wouldn’t be a huge
personal problem for us even if our existence were revealed. The problem
is that the world would be turned upside down. If it became known that
our abilities are verifiable superpowers, religious beliefs could be
shattered, leading to great chaos like wars, and dangerous people might
appear wanting to misuse our powers. Never forget that we are beings who
quietly adjust the world’s balance from behind the scenes. Always be
careful, careful, and more careful. If you ever find yourself in an
unavoidable situation, the best course of action is to first send a
telepathic message to the Great Maiden and ask for her
wisdom.<a href="prompts.html#A:6" class="comment-marker">[A:6]</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>What else am I forgetting? Oh! You must always be careful to prevent
ordinary people, non-maidens, from entering the shrine’s boundary. If
they do enter, their souls, unable to bear the shrine’s spiritual
weight, will suffer extreme pain. We usually immobilize them to protect
them and then send them back outside the boundary, but pain is still
pain, so it’s best to prevent them from entering in the first place.
There’s a mailbox right in front of the boundary, so communicating with
the outside world through analog methods like letters is one option.</p>
<p>The task we have is truly a heavy one. It’s a job that might take an
eternity. But that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun doing it, right? Don’t
be too impatient or push yourself too hard. The world is always
changing, and new things are constantly happening, so I hope you’ll
sometimes tune into those changes and enjoy your life as a maiden for a
long, long time. And who knows? When new maidens come to the shrine
after you, you might get some unexpected, fresh inspiration from
them!</p>
<p>Alright, I think that’s all the basic stuff I can tell you for now. I
sincerely hope this “Maiden Life Guide” is of some help to you in your
new life at the shrine. Whenever you have a question, don’t suffer in
silence—come ask the other maidens or me. We’re all here to help each
other and be together!</p>
<p>So, I wish you all the best in unfolding your life as a maiden!</p>
<p>From
Aki.<a href="prompts.html#A:7" class="comment-marker">[A:7]</a></p>
