<p>Lua gained a deeper understanding of her transformation ability
through the experiences she had as Shizuku’s clothing and the Great
Maiden’s explanations. She realized how crucial it was to perfectly
understand and embody the functions and properties of the object
transformed into, beyond simply changing its shape. She was greatly
inspired by Aki becoming a television to gain external information and
Miho transforming into a bookshelf to preserve knowledge.</p>
<p>One day, Lua felt a sudden sense of discomfort when she saw the
maidens preparing to visit another shrine. They always had to walk, or
sometimes go down to the village to use public transportation. The
distance between shrines was considerable, sometimes taking more than a
day for a round trip.</p>
<p>‘How convenient would it be if we could move ourselves?’</p>
<p>A sudden thought flashed through Lua’s mind. And she decided. To help
the maidens with their travel, she would become an electric car. Not
just a moving mass, but a perfectly functional, real car.</p>
<p>Lua immediately sought out the Great Maiden’s avatar and expressed
her resolve. The Great Maiden nodded and smiled at Lua’s bold
decision.</p>
<p>“That’s an excellent idea, Lua. Your ability will be a great help to
the maidens.”</p>
<p>The very next day, Lua’s special training began. The first thing she
was given was a thick electric car repair manual. It wasn’t just a
simple user manual, but a professional mechanic’s manual. The hundreds
of pages were filled with complex circuit diagrams, parts descriptions,
and troubleshooting procedures.</p>
<p>Lua opened the manual within the boundary. At first, the words in
front of her eyes seemed like complex symbols. However, she knew that to
achieve a perfect transformation like Aki or Miho, she had to understand
the internal principles, not just mimic the external appearance.</p>
<p>She meticulously read every page of the manual. The composition of
the battery module, the role of the power control unit (PCU), the
operating principles of the motor, the regenerative braking system, and
even the sensor array and data processing methods for autonomous
driving—she ingrained every detail in her mind. Beyond merely reading
with her eyes, she felt a sense of immersion as if the information was
being etched into her body. Sometimes, she would look at the
illustrations in the manual and transform her own body into the
corresponding parts. She would become a small gear, or a complex bundle
of wires.</p>
<p>Lua delved into the manual day and night. She read it over and over
until the pages were worn out. She completely understood all the
technical requirements and operating principles of an electric car, and
she was preparing to embody them in her own flesh. Imagining the maidens
comfortably traveling to other shrines within the electric car that was
her, Lua willingly memorized
everything.<a href="prompts.html#2:1" class="comment-marker">[2:1]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>After studying the repair manual day and night, Lua perfectly
understood every detailed structure and operating principle of the
electric car. Now, all that remained was the real test. The Great Maiden
and the other maidens gathered in the shrine courtyard, eagerly
anticipating Lua’s first transformation. Lua took a deep breath and
envisioned the form of an electric car. The sleek body, the gleaming
headlights, and the detail of each individual wheel. Her body began to
glow and change.</p>
<p>In an instant, a brand-new electric car appeared where Lua had been
standing. It was not a mere model. It was a real car, perfectly
realized, from the deep grooves of the tires to the charging port, and
even the complex dashboard inside. Lua felt her body become a massive
machine composed of steel, wires, and batteries. She could feel the
subtle vibrations of the battery, beating like a heart instead of an
engine.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing was the driver’s seat. A small avatar of
Lua sat in it like a driver. This avatar followed Lua’s will exactly,
serving to prepare for any potential external checks or unexpected
situations.</p>
<p>To become a perfect car, Lua had to overcome another hurdle: a
driver’s license and vehicle registration. It was somewhat ironic that a
maiden had to follow the laws of the human world, but the Great Maiden
explained it was an essential part of external activities.</p>
<p>At this point, Shizuku stepped forward. Shizuku skillfully
transformed into Lua’s appearance. To drive the car that Lua herself had
transformed into, another Lua was needed. Shizuku perfectly reproduced
Lua’s actual appearance, voice, and even her small habits.</p>
<p>A few days later, the Lua that Shizuku had become sat in the driver’s
seat of the electric car that Lua had transformed into. On the way to
the city’s driver’s license test center, Shizuku skillfully operated
Lua, the car. She used the sensors embedded throughout Lua’s body to
perfectly park in the parking course, and displayed agile yet stable
driving skills during the road test. The examiner stamped Lua’s license
with admiration.</p>
<p>Next was vehicle registration. The Lua that Shizuku had become drove
the electric car that Lua had transformed into to the vehicle
registration office and completed all the paperwork. Lua felt the cold
sensation of the license plate being attached to her body, realizing
that she had officially become a registered car in the world.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the day of her first long-distance debut, Lua set off with the
maidens visiting another shrine. Before starting, Lua indulged in all
sorts of delicious foods in the shrine’s kitchen to ‘refuel’. Greasy
meat, sweet fruits, and warm soup—she stuffed her mouth with food like a
mukbang YouTuber. Her ‘fuel’ was food, and although she was a maiden who
didn’t need any food to survive, if the transformed car’s energy ran
out, her body was at risk of returning to its original form.</p>
<p>While driving on the highway, Lua felt a strange thrill speeding at
over 100 kilometers per hour. The scenery rushing by outside the window,
the sound of the wind, and the subtle vibrations of the road
surface—everything was new. The maidens sat comfortably, chatting.</p>
<p>After a few hours, Lua felt the ‘fuel level’ displayed on the
dashboard decreasing. At the same time, she felt a subtle trembling in
her body and a sense of performance degradation.</p>
<p>“Shizuku-san, I’m low on fuel… I need to eat something.”</p>
<p>Lua’s urgent telepathy reached Shizuku. Shizuku nodded and drove the
car to the next rest stop. As soon as they arrived at the rest stop, the
maidens quickly bought snacks and brought them to Lua.</p>
<p>“Here, Lua. How about some corn dogs and onion rings? We have
more!”</p>
<p>The maidens pushed the food through the window into the mouth of
Lua’s avatar, who was sitting in the driver’s seat. Lua absorbed the
savory flavor of the corn dogs and the crispy onion rings in an instant.
As the food entered her body, the trembling miraculously stopped, and
she felt her energy recharge.</p>
<p>“Mmm, it’s delicious! I feel energized again!”</p>
<p>Lua sent a satisfied telepathic message, and the maidens laughed and
got back into the car. In this way, Lua successfully completed her first
long-distance drive and performed the important role of being the
maidens’ transportation. She had now proven herself to be not just a
simple maiden, but a being with infinite possibilities, capable of
transforming into any form as
needed.<a href="prompts.html#2:2" class="comment-marker">[2:2]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>It had been a year. Lua stood in front of the gate of her old house,
wearing a neat dress and cardigan that Shizuku had transformed into.
Life at the shrine was peaceful for an immortal being, but the longing
for her family was inevitable. Lua’s heart ached more and more as she
thought about how much her parents must have searched for her after her
sudden disappearance. Suddenly, Shizuku’s warm telepathy soothed Lua’s
heart.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’m by your side.”</p>
<p>Ding-dong. The doorbell rang, and her mother’s surprised face
appeared.</p>
<p>“Yui! Is that really our Yui? It’s been so long!”</p>
<p>Her mother called Lua by her real name, Yui, and hugged Lua tightly.
A mix of joy and relief washed over her face at the sight of her
daughter, who seemed a little more mature after a year. Her father
silently stroked Lua’s head, his eyes welling up.</p>
<p>They sat facing each other with warm tea. Her parents’ worries proved
to be greater than expected.</p>
<p>“Where have you been all this time, and how have you been? Without
any contact… Do you know how worried we were?”</p>
<p>Lua was speechless at her mother’s question. She couldn’t reveal the
shrine’s secret. She could only offer a vague excuse, saying she had
been “recuperating in a deep mountain for a while due to illness.” Her
parents’ faces were still filled with questions and worry.</p>
<p>It was then. Shizuku’s voice resonated in Lua’s mind. “Lua, ask your
mother about the neighborhood where I lived as a child. The one with a
small stream and many cherry blossom trees. And ask her about my friend
Hozue Mika.”</p>
<p>Lua was puzzled by Shizuku’s request but immediately sensed that
Shizuku was trying something important. Lua cautiously asked her
mother,</p>
<p>“Mom, did you happen to have a best friend named Hozue Mika when you
were little? In a neighborhood near a stream with lots of cherry
blossoms…”</p>
<p>Her mother’s eyes widened. Surprise mixed with faint memories
flickered across her face.</p>
<p>“Mika! How do you know that name? I haven’t heard that name in ages.
Yes, that’s right. Hozue Mika was my very close friend when I was
little. We were always together… but then she suddenly moved, and we
lost touch. I always wondered how she was doing.”</p>
<p>Her mother smiled, nostalgic at the name of her old friend. Then
Shizuku’s telepathy reached Lua again. “Ask your mother about Mika’s
most cherished old doll. And that one of the doll’s eyes was a
button.”</p>
<p>Lua carefully continued,</p>
<p>“Mom, did Mika-san really cherish an old doll that had one button
eye?”</p>
<p>Her mother looked at Lua, startled.</p>
<p>“My goodness! How do you know that? That was our secret, no one else
knew! Mika-chan really loved that doll…. Where did you hear that?”</p>
<p>Her mother’s eyes contained certainty mixed with an unknown light.
Lua was using Shizuku’s knowledge to erase her parents’ doubts. Shizuku
continued to send Lua telepathic messages of childhood memories that
only her mother would know, and Lua recounted them in detail as if she
had experienced them herself. Through the stories Lua told, her mother
seemed to glimpse Shizuku’s presence—a mysterious power—and began to
vaguely accept that her daughter had become a special being, different
from ordinary people. Lua’s face now held an unknown power and
wisdom.</p>
<p>When it was time to say goodbye, her mother hugged Lua tightly and
said,</p>
<p>“Yui, anyway, I’m really glad you’re healthy and doing well. And… if
you happen to meet Mika-chan later, please be sure to tell her I said
hello. Thanks to you, I thought of my old friend after a long time, and
I was so happy to hear about her.”</p>
<p>Lua felt awkward through Shizuku’s telepathy at her mother’s request.
Shizuku’s perplexed reaction, “What should I do about this?” was
directly conveyed to Lua’s mind. She was facing Lua’s mother as Lua’s
clothing, and yet her mother was asking her to convey regards to
herself. Shizuku inwardly sighed deeply in embarrassment. Lua forced a
smile and nodded as if nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mom. I’ll be sure to tell her.”</p>
<p>Lua’s appearance as she left the house was different from before.
Although she hadn’t completely dispelled her parents’ worries, she
seemed to have gained at least a minimum understanding thanks to
Shizuku’s wisdom. Lua once again felt the weight of the secret that she,
Shizuku, and the other maidens protected, and she headed back towards
the
shrine.<a href="prompts.html#2:3" class="comment-marker">[2:3]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>On the way back to the shrine after the short family reunion, Lua,
dressed in the clothes Shizuku had transformed into, suddenly fell into
thought while walking. When she had transformed into an electric car,
her avatar in the driver’s seat was fully clothed. But when she became
Shizuku’s clothes, Lua herself directly became the clothing, enveloping
Shizuku’s body. Why could she exist as a complete avatar in some
transformations, but only choose to be a part of the body as clothing in
others?</p>
<p>“Shizuku-san,” Lua asked telepathically. “I was suddenly curious,
when I turned into a car, my avatar was fully clothed and sitting in the
driver’s seat, right? But when I become Shizuku-san’s clothes like now,
why do I have to become the clothes directly? Why can’t I choose to be
clothing as part of my body?”</p>
<p>Shizuku also pondered for a moment. “Hmm, now that you mention it,
that’s true. I hadn’t thought of that part. I just took it for granted
because it’s always been that way.” A hint of curiosity was in her
voice. “Inside the boundary, the maiden’s robes exist as part of our
bodies, but they disappear when we go outside, so maybe that’s why we
have to become the clothes directly… The avatar in the driver’s seat had
seemed so lifelike.”</p>
<p>As soon as they returned to the shrine, Lua and Shizuku went to find
the Great Maiden’s avatar. The Great Maiden, who was drinking tea,
smiled gently at the two maidens’ curious faces.</p>
<p>“Your questions haven’t been resolved, have they? You’re asking why
Lua’s avatar, when she transformed into a car, could be fully clothed,
and why you both have to exist as part of the body when you become each
other’s clothes, right?”</p>
<p>Lua and Shizuku nodded.</p>
<p>“To answer that question, I need to tell you a very old story.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden began to speak in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, the Divine blessed the maidens with the ability to
‘freely transform into any form whatsoever.’ At first, all maidens could
create perfect avatars as they wished, and even dress those avatars.
Just like Lua’s avatar when you transformed into a car now.”</p>
<p>Lua and Shizuku held their breath, waiting for the next part of the
story.</p>
<p>“But problems soon arose. The maidens did not use their
transformations responsibly like you do. Some maidens would create
dozens of avatars and go down to the village, confusing people, while
others would make their avatars play all sorts of pranks, or even do bad
things. Since their true bodies were hidden in the shrine, they faced no
repercussions. The world fell into chaos, and distrust towards the
shrine grew.”</p>
<p>A faint sadness crossed the Great Maiden’s expression.</p>
<p>“The Divine let out a deep sigh. The blessing she had given the
maidens had instead become a tool to disturb the world. So, the Divine
decided to place ‘restrictions’ on the maidens’ transformation ability.
The restriction was this: ‘Only when transforming into an inanimate
object can a complete avatar be created, and that avatar can be
clothed.’ This was because when transforming into an inanimate object,
the true body completely assimilates with that object, so just as a
car’s driver is part of the car, the avatar also comes under the
complete control of the true body. This prevented the avatar during an
inanimate transformation from acting on its own. However, she placed the
restriction that ‘when becoming the clothing of another living creature,
the maiden herself must become the clothing and exist as part of the
body.’ This was to ensure that the maidens would bear responsibility for
each other, move as one body, and not abuse their abilities
carelessly.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden took another sip of tea.</p>
<p>“Therefore, the reason Lua’s avatar was fully clothed when you
transformed into a car is because a car is an inanimate object, and the
reason Lua herself became the clothing when she became Shizuku’s clothes
is because becoming clothing is a union with another living creature.
All of this was a wise choice made by the Divine to prevent the maidens’
abilities from harming the harmony of the world.”</p>
<p>Lua and Shizuku nodded as they listened to the Great Maiden’s story.
Their curiosity was resolved, and they once again realized the deeper
meaning hidden within the transformation ability. The Divine’s blessing
always came with deep meaning and
responsibility.<a href="prompts.html#2:4" class="comment-marker">[2:4]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In celebration of memorizing the repair manual, Lua went to thank the
Great Maiden. The Great Maiden’s abode was as quiet and orderly as ever,
but today, a subtle, familiar scent of paper was subtly mixed with the
usual faint aroma. The Great Maiden was not sitting in her usual spot,
but instead was engrossed in something on a soft cushion by the
window.</p>
<p>As Lua cautiously approached, she noticed what the Great Maiden held
in her hands. It was none other than a thick comic book. The cover
depicted a boy swordsman in a dynamic pose, and the title was boldly
written: <em>Flame Swordsman Kaen</em>. Lua rubbed her eyes. The Great
Maiden, who always appeared dignified and wise, was reading a shonen
manga. Unbelievable!</p>
<p>The Great Maiden, sensing Lua’s gaze, was startled and hid the comic
book behind her lap. Lua didn’t miss the faint blush that crept onto her
cheeks.</p>
<p>“Ah, Lua, you’ve come? That… well… this is what I was looking
at.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden spoke in a slightly embarrassed, and hushed voice.
It was a touch of human embarrassment rarely seen in an immortal being.
Lua tried to suppress her laughter.</p>
<p>“Yes, Great Maiden. But… you were reading a comic book.”</p>
<p>At Lua’s words, the Great Maiden cleared her throat and carefully
brought the comic book back out.</p>
<p>“Hmm… actually, I sometimes read shonen manga like this. You might
find it a bit surprising.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden gently stroked the comic book cover with her
finger.</p>
<p>“Look at the protagonist in this manga. He doesn’t give in to
adversity, but constantly strives and grows. He works with his friends
to achieve what seems impossible. That kind of pure and fervent passion…
is sometimes necessary.”</p>
<p>She gazed at the mountains far outside the window.</p>
<p>“When you live for a long time, everything becomes familiar, and
sometimes even the will to live fades. Understanding the ways of the
world and truth is important, but sometimes, such primordial and pure
passion can breathe life into a withered heart.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden smiled, looking at the comic book again.</p>
<p>“As a maiden, I teach you wisdom and tranquility, but I too need a
small driving force to keep moving forward and not get exhausted. Like
the boys in this manga, it’s to not forget the simple, passionate
mindset of striving towards a goal. Although this shrine will exist
forever, we who live within it must also continue to grow.”</p>
<p>Lua nodded as she listened to the Great Maiden’s explanation. In her
words, Lua felt the deep contemplation of a being who had lived for
ages, and yet still strived not to lose the vitality of life. Lua
understood that the shonen manga was not merely entertainment, but a
small yet precious source of vitality for the Great Maiden herself. In
Lua’s eyes, the Great Maiden seemed even more human and
venerable.<a href="prompts.html#2:5" class="comment-marker">[2:5]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In a spacious courtyard at a corner of the shrine, Aki—always neatly
dressed in maiden robes with her hair braided—was holding a small
sketchbook and meticulously drawing bundles of wires or unknown machine
parts. Her gaze was as clear and rational as ever, as if logically
analyzing every phenomenon. Lua cautiously approached Aki as she worked
and spoke.</p>
<p>“Aki-san, could you perhaps transform into a piano for me? I learned
to play the piano when I was little, and I’d like to play it again.”</p>
<p>Aki looked up from her sketchbook and gazed at Lua. A hint of
bewilderment flickered across her expression.</p>
<p>“A piano? Hmm… I’m confident in electronics and communication
protocols, but a piano… I understand its mechanical structure, but the
acoustic principles or the subtle mechanisms of each key are not areas
I’m familiar with.”</p>
<p>Lua was inwardly surprised to discover an unexpected weakness in Aki,
who always perfectly understood and transformed into everything. But at
the same time, an inexplicable sense of pride swelled within her at the
thought of being able to teach Aki.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Aki-san! I’ll explain it to you!”</p>
<p>Lua cheerfully exclaimed and led Aki to the old library that the
Great Maiden had shown them. Among the dusty bookshelves, she found an
old book explaining piano structures and opened it.</p>
<p>“Alright, Aki-san. A piano is basically composed of keys, hammers,
strings, and a soundboard.”</p>
<p>Lua pointed to the illustrations in the book with her finger as she
explained. Aki, with an unusually serious face, listened to Lua’s
explanation and began sketching the internal structure of the piano in
her sketchbook. Her eyes were still sharp, but this time, they seemed to
be delving into the complex arrangement of wood and strings, not
electronic circuits.</p>
<p>“When you press a key, the hammer moves and strikes the string. When
the string vibrates, it makes a sound. And this sound is amplified
through the soundboard. The important thing is that the depth and speed
of each key press change the force with which the hammer strikes the
string, subtly altering the volume and resonance of the sound.”</p>
<p>Lua tapped the air with her fingers, mimicking pressing keys.</p>
<p>“Especially this damper part is important; when you press a key, the
damper lifts off the string to make a sound, and when you release it, it
reattaches to the string to stop the sound. Also, when you press the
pedal, the damper lifts off the strings, causing the sound to resonate
longer, or even producing a different sound.”</p>
<p>Aki nodded as she listened to Lua’s explanation. Her sketchbook
already contained intricate hammer mechanisms and string tension
adjustment devices, precisely drawn. “Ultimately, all these mechanical
parts work in harmony to create acoustic beauty. It’s an analog
precision, different from the electronic signals I’m used to.” Aki
rarely expressed such admiration.</p>
<p>At the library entrance, several maidens were observing the
interesting sight. It was quite a novel sight for them: Aki, who always
created things with such sharp precision, was now the student, while
Lua, who was usually the one learning, had become the teacher. They
quietly smiled and watched the two maidens’ passionate lesson.</p>
<hr />
<p>A few days later, Lua and Aki finally stood in the shrine courtyard.
Aki took a deep breath and recalled all the structures and principles of
the piano that Lua had explained. And her body began to glow and
transform.</p>
<p>A harmonious form of steel and wood appeared, and black and white
keys were meticulously arranged. Finally, Aki transformed into a massive
yet beautiful upright piano. Its glossy black exterior and neatly
aligned keys stood majestically.</p>
<p>Lua, with a heart full of emotion, sat in front of Aki, who had
transformed into a piano. She carefully reached out and placed her hands
on the keys. The piano was Aki herself, but at the same time, it was the
instrument Lua had longed for for a long time.</p>
<p>As Lua pressed the first key, a clear and resonant sound echoed
through the courtyard. As her fingers moved, Aki’s internal mechanisms
responded precisely, expressing various timbres and dynamics. Lua soon
recalled the melodies she used to play as a child and began to perform.
A beautiful melody filled the shrine courtyard, and the other maidens
held their breath, appreciating the music. Aki also seemed to feel deep
satisfaction from the beautiful sounds flowing from her
body.<a href="prompts.html#2:6" class="comment-marker">[2:6]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>When winter arrived at the shrine, the mountains were covered in
pristine white snow. Snowflakes bloomed on every branch, and thick
blankets of snow piled up on the roofs. Although they were immortal
beings within the boundary, the maidens also felt the cold when they
were in human form. With the chilling cold seemingly seeping into their
bones, the maidens naturally gathered together.</p>
<p>However, winter at the shrine was not painful. The maidens’ special
abilities transformed even the harsh cold into joy.</p>
<p>The first thing that stood out was the warm air emanating from
various parts of the shrine. In the central hall of the shrine, Hinata,
transformed into a stove, was lighting red charcoal. The heat radiating
from her body instantly dispelled the cold air, providing warmth. The
maidens gathered around the stove, warming their cold hands and
chatting. In one room, Kana, transformed into a boiler, was warming the
heated floor. The maidens would lie down and rest their tired bodies in
the cozy warmth rising from the floor. Lua sat by the stove, enjoying
the winter atmosphere while listening to the crackling of the
flames.</p>
<p>Winter delicacies were also not to be missed. A savory aroma wafted
from the kitchen. There, an unexpected transformed being awaited: Aoi,
transformed into an air fryer. With her sleek silver body and perfectly
realized digital panel, Aoi was diligently making winter snacks.</p>
<p>“Alright, the roasted chestnuts are coming out now!”</p>
<p>Perfectly roasted chestnuts poured out from inside Aoi. Soon after,
steaming roasted sweet potatoes and whole roasted chickens, crispy on
the outside and moist on the inside, came out one after another. The
maidens laughed as they tasted the warm and delicious food that Aoi had
roasted. Lua blew on a freshly roasted chestnut and tasted it. While a
normal air fryer would have limitations in temperature control or
cooking time, Aoi perfectly controlled all the functions of the air
fryer she had transformed into, achieving the best taste.</p>
<p>Some maidens drank warm tea and talked about Aoi’s air fryer
transformation. “At first, everyone was puzzled why Aoi wanted to be an
air fryer. But since she can warm so much food at once, there’s no
better transformation for winter, is there?” One maiden said with a
laugh.</p>
<p>Winter at the shrine was not a harsh cold, but a warm and vibrant
season with the maidens’ warm transformation abilities. Thanks to the
warmth provided by the stove and boiler, and the delicious food offered
by the air fryer, the maidens were able to share their warmth with each
other and spend a cozy winter even in the
cold.<a href="prompts.html#2:7" class="comment-marker">[2:7]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The shrine seemed isolated from the world, but sometimes it
interacted with the outside, revealing its presence. One such occasion
was the village festival. Since outsiders could not enter the shrine
grounds, the festival site was set in a wide flat area near the shrine
entrance. The villagers eagerly awaited the annual festival held in
front of the mysterious shrine.</p>
<p>The highlight of the festival was undoubtedly the kagura performances
by the maidens. Kagura, a sacred dance ritual offered to the gods, was
majestic and beautiful in itself. In this festival, three maidens danced
the kagura.</p>
<p>Akane transformed into a splendid costume of red and white, forming
the centerpiece of the dance. Her body fluttered like soft silk,
shimmering with light with every movement. Akane’s movements were
elegant and disciplined, and her costume transformation further enhanced
the beauty of the dance.</p>
<p>And the clear sound of bells accompanying the dance was handled by
Aki. Aki transformed into small bells that were attached to Akane’s
wrists and ankles. She perfectly controlled the volume and rhythm of the
sound, leading the flow of the dance. The bell sounds, sometimes
cheerful, sometimes mysterious, seemed to show that Aki understood not
only physical forms but also sound waves.</p>
<p>Shizuku transformed into a thin veil that moved as smoothly as the
wind, matching the dance movements of the maidens performing the kagura.
She cut through the air, following the maidens’ movements, adding a
mysterious atmosphere. Sometimes she would lightly cover a maiden’s face
and then reveal it, intensifying the mystique. Shizuku’s veil became
part of the dance, revealing an invisible presence.</p>
<p>Lua played an important role from the festival preparation stage. She
transformed into a transport cart to carry the necessary items for the
festival. With sturdy wheels and a spacious loading area, Lua was a
great help in carrying handmade crafts, food ingredients, and
decorations from the shrine to the festival grounds.</p>
<p>When the festival began, Lua transformed into another form. She
became a large digital display for festival guidance. She displayed
festival programs and locations in colorful letters, and sometimes
showed beautiful pictures to heighten the festive mood. Of course, Lua’s
display did not reveal any secrets of the shrine. It simply focused on
helping the villagers conveniently enjoy the festival.</p>
<p>As the sun set and darkness fell, Lua transformed into a bright
streetlamp, illuminating the festival grounds. Her light shone on
people’s faces until the end of the festival, making them smile warmly.
The maidens helped the festival in their own ways, and their
transformation abilities, while meticulously concealing the shrine’s
secrets, enriched the festival even further. The villagers once again
confirmed the existence of the mysterious maidens and looked forward to
the festival next
year.<a href="prompts.html#2:8" class="comment-marker">[2:8]</a></p>
