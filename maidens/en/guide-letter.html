<p>To my esteemed Senior, Aki,</p>
<p>I have perused the <em>Maiden Life Guide</em> which thou didst strive
to create. Upon first encountering this ‘Guide,’ I confess I
comprehended not its meaning, yet by the context, I soon divined it to
signify a book of precepts or a way-finding scroll. Throughout my
perusal of the tome, I could feel thy deep wisdom and profound affection
for the maidens imbued in every line. The exposition upon fidelity and
comprehension especially filled me with no small wonder, for its
teachings are far more ordered than the lore of my own corporeal days. I
doubt not it shall be of great aid to young maidens such as Lua and
Izumi.</p>
<p>Howbeit, Senior, one great regret lingers within me regarding this
guide. Thou didst declare it for ‘those newly become maidens,’ yet
wherefore is there no section for one such as myself, who, freed from
long penance, is a maiden once more?</p>
<p>Verily, I am one of the eldest maidens, yet during the past six
hundred and fifty years when my flesh was a teapot, the ways of the
world and the life of a maiden have transformed beyond measure. My
transformation ability remains, yet the sensation of my body floating,
untethered to the ground, or the feeling of my inner essence diffusing
as tea leaves steep in water—I find it nigh impossible to accustom
myself to such things. The world I knew was of centuries past; this
world is vastly different. I do mightily wonder why counsel on how to
live again as a maiden in a world so strange is absent.</p>
<p>As I understand it, my penance alone was finite. Perchance none shall
again face a plight as peculiar as mine. Nevertheless, methinks a guide
should rightfully encompass a broader range of readers. I urge you not
to set forth all things in this volume at once. I did but wish to impart
that consideration for the few, for the unique cases, is also needed.
Should there be other maidens who have undergone such singular
experiences, this guide would become more complete still were it to
include even a small word of counsel for them.</p>
<p>Fortuitously, during my time as a teapot, through tales recounted by
the Great Maiden and scripts newly encountered, I have come to grasp the
new letters and speech of this land. By this good hap, I am now able to
send this letter to thee, not in the Gothic script I might have penned
aforetime, but in these new characters, which I deem fortunate.</p>
<p>Should my missive perchance have wrought e’en a slight wound upon thy
labors, prithee, judge it with a generous heart. Know, I pray thee, that
these words were tendered solely from a heart that wishes this guide to
shine forth as a brighter star unto all maidens.</p>
<p>May thy days be ever tranquil.</p>
<p>From
Yukina.<a href="prompts.html#C:1" class="comment-marker">[C:1]</a></p>
