<p>The time had come for Lua, the shrine’s electric car, to undergo its
regular inspection. Even if her exterior was perfect, it was a legally
mandated procedure, and preventing any unforeseen malfunctions was also
part of a maiden’s responsibility. Lua, with her avatar seated within
her, headed to the repair shop, driven by Akari, who was wearing clothes
that were a transformed Shizuku. The repair shop was an ordinary place.
It was a world entirely different from the shrine’s tranquility, filled
with the smell of oil, the noise of machinery, and unfamiliar parts
scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>“Welcome! Here for your regular inspection, right?”</p>
<p>The mechanic greeted them kindly and meticulously examined Lua’s
body. Akari got out of the car, and Lua had to fully entrust her body to
the mechanic’s hands.</p>
<p>First, the engine compartment was opened. As the hood lifted, Lua was
overcome with a strange sensation, as if her very heart was being
exposed. The mechanic’s flashlight beam illuminated every corner of her
internal circuits and battery modules. Lua felt the light probing her
insides throughout her entire body. It was the sensation of her wire
bundles, coolant pipes, and complexly intertwined sensors—all once
hidden under covers—being laid bare. Every small vibration from the
mechanic touching wires and tightening bolts felt as vivid to Lua as a
touch on her skin.</p>
<p>“Battery cell voltage is good, and the coolant is fine.”</p>
<p>The mechanic’s murmurs were transmitted directly through every part
of Lua’s body—the car itself. It felt as if someone was reporting on the
state of her own blood circulation.</p>
<p>Next was the undercarriage inspection. Lua was lifted onto a hoist,
her body floating in the air. The mechanic crawled underneath and began
to inspect her underside. The dull thud of tapping the suspension, the
feeling of fingers rubbing to check brake pad wear, and the subtle
tremor of shaking the driveshaft to check for play—everything was felt
directly through Lua’s senses. It was the first time her underside had
been examined in such detail.</p>
<p>The most sensitive moment was when the diagnostic device was
connected. The mechanic plugged a cable into Lua’s charging port and
checked numerous data points on a laptop. Lua felt the sensation of
being directly connected to the mechanic’s device through her
communication circuits—her nervous system, so to speak. It was a subtly
ticklish and vulnerable sensation, as if all her electronic signals and
sensor information were flowing outward, completely unfiltered.</p>
<p>“No issues! It’s very clean. Looks like you’ve been taking good care
of it!”</p>
<p>As the mechanic finished speaking, Lua descended from the hoist and
touched the ground again. A sense of relief finally washed over her as
the external touch that had meticulously examined her body disappeared.
Though brief, the experience of having her deepest self revealed to
another was a fresh shock for Lua. At the same time, it was a chance to
realize once again just how intricate and perfect the body created by
her transformation ability truly was.</p>
<p>Akari climbed into Lua’s inspected body, and Lua left the repair shop
to return to the quiet embrace of the shrine. The experience of being
scrutinized to her very core was unfamiliar, but Lua prepared for her
next transformation, considering this, too, a part of understanding the
ways of the
world.<a href="prompts.html#4:1" class="comment-marker">[4:1]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Izumi now perfectly understood the special quality of her small body.
While the fact that she would live forever as a little girl sometimes
brought a faint sense of regret, she realized it also allowed her to
perform more delicate and precise transformations. After ten years of
shrine life, Izumi began to contribute in ways no one else could, all
thanks to her small body.</p>
<p>The wooden floor of the shrine’s main hall was wide, and fine dust
often accumulated in the cracks of the old timber. It was a
time-consuming task for the maidens to clean themselves. One day, seeing
this, Izumi had an idea.</p>
<p>“I’ll clean it for you!”</p>
<p>With those words, Izumi glowed and transformed. Her small body became
a round, flat robotic vacuum cleaner. Small brushes were attached to its
main body, and a faint whirring sound emanated from its suction port.
Izumi expertly zipped across the shrine floor, sucking up dust. Using
the sensors in her body, she accurately navigated into corners and under
furniture, not missing even the finest dust in the floor’s cracks.</p>
<p>“Wow, the floor is sparkling thanks to Izumi!”</p>
<p>Lua exclaimed, admiring the spot where the robotic-vacuum-Izumi had
passed. After finishing, Izumi returned to her original form and smiled
brightly. “How was that? Because I’m small, I can get into every nook
and cranny!” Thanks to her efforts, the shrine floor was always kept
spotlessly clean.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, because the shrine was old, the small, cherished items
used by the maidens would often go missing. Small accessories and
needles, in particular, were easily lost and often couldn’t be found no
matter how hard they searched.</p>
<p>One day, a small gem from Akari’s cherished hair ornament fell off
and disappeared. Everyone searched for it desperately, but it was
nowhere to be found. That’s when Izumi stepped forward.</p>
<p>“I’ll look for it!”</p>
<p>Izumi transformed her body into a high-powered magnifying glass. Her
body became a transparent glass lens with a handle, her vision magnified
dozens of times. In her magnifying glass form, Izumi meticulously
scoured the floor’s tiny cracks and the dust within them, aiming to find
fragments too small for the naked eye.</p>
<p>While magnifying a minuscule crack in the floorboards, Izumi soon
spotted something faintly glittering.</p>
<p>“It’s here! Akari’s hair ornament gem!”</p>
<p>At Izumi’s cry, the other maidens gathered around in surprise. There,
in the spot Izumi indicated, was the tiny gem, buried in the dust.
Thanks to Izumi’s help, the precious lost item was found again.</p>
<p>Most of the shrine’s belongings were old and frequently needed small
repairs. Tasks requiring the tightening of tiny screws, like those in
delicate clocks or complex locks, were difficult even for the
maidens.</p>
<p>Aki was trying to repair a broken grandfather clock. A small screw
was set too deep to be reached with a regular screwdriver. That’s when
Izumi approached.</p>
<p>“Aki-san, may I help?”</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Izumi transformed her body into a precision
screwdriver. Her small body became a thin, sharp screwdriver bit, while
the handle part reshaped to allow for precise rotation. Held in Aki’s
hand, Izumi moved like a perfect tool. Her body found the tiny screw
head, fit into it perfectly, and rotated with delicate precision,
tightening the wobbly screw completely.</p>
<p>“Amazing, Izumi! The repair was so much easier thanks to you.”</p>
<p>Aki marveled at Izumi’s precise transformation ability. Even with her
small body, Izumi was growing into an indispensable presence at the
shrine. As an eternal little girl, she had become a precious maiden,
vital to every corner of the shrine wherever a delicate task was
needed.<a href="prompts.html#4:2" class="comment-marker">[4:2]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In the deepest part of the shrine, the Great Maiden’s abode was
always filled with a mysterious aura. Lua, Shizuku, Akari, and Izumi sat
before the Great Maiden, listening to her story. Today, she was telling
them of the time she first became a maiden. Her avatar closed her eyes,
seemingly reminiscing about the distant past.</p>
<p>“My story is quite different from the world you know. It is a tale
from a distant time, an era that was called the Age of Myths.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden’s voice was soft, yet it held a grandeur that seemed
to contain millennia.</p>
<p>“Back then, the world was not as orderly as it is now. The boundary
between the heavens and the earth was blurred; it was an age of chaos
where humans, gods, and all other beings lived intermingled. I was an
ordinary human child then. But I was a little different from the others.
I could feel the sounds of the world, the whispers of the wind, and the
vibrations of the earth far more clearly than anyone else.”</p>
<p>She paused, her gaze lost in the distance.</p>
<p>“One day, a great catastrophe struck the world. Ceaseless rains
poured from the sky, threatening to swallow the land, and tremors that
seemed to tear everything apart shook the earth without end. People
trembled in fear, and the gods, vying for power against one another,
only fueled the chaos. Amidst all that pandemonium, watching the world
spiral toward ruin, I fell into a deep sorrow.”</p>
<p>“I prayed desperately. For an end to the chaos, for the salvation of
all life. My prayers continued day and night, and my earnest pleas must
have reached the heavens, for at one moment, a great pillar of light
descended upon me.”</p>
<p>A flicker of the awe she felt then crossed the Great Maiden’s
face.</p>
<p>“Within that light, I came to understand all the knowledge of the
world and the principles of creation. My physical body was reborn by the
light, and I felt myself connect to the fundamental power of the world.
I became a being who no longer felt cold, hunger, or the fear of death.
And then, a powerful voice echoed within me.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“‘You are the one who shall keep the balance of the world. Your body
will be the bridge that connects this world and the gods, and your
existence shall forever protect this land.’ That voice gave me the power
to create a boundary, and within it, the ability to transcend the limits
of matter. I accepted the will of the Divine and built the first shrine
here in these mountains.”</p>
<p>She quietly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“And so, I became the first maiden of the shrine, and a part of my
body became this very building. I hide the fact that I am the building
and use an avatar to meet you all because, in the Age of Myths, a being
like me becoming the shrine itself was a way to connect with the world
and prevent chaos. In a way, my very existence became a testament to the
harmony between the Divine, humans, and the world.”</p>
<p>The maidens held their breath at the Great Maiden’s story. They
realized that the shrine where they lived had its origins in such a
grand and mysterious beginning, born from the Age of Myths. The Great
Maiden was not merely a maiden; she was living history, an eternal being
carrying out the will of the
Divine.<a href="prompts.html#4:3" class="comment-marker">[4:3]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Clutching the Great Maiden’s letter, Lua quickened her pace. Unlike
their own shrine, which transcended the limits of matter, this
destination was mysterious in a different way: it was a place that
transcended the limits of time, where beings who perceived the past and
future simultaneously resided. The Great Maiden had once explained that
the maidens there saw “all of time spread out like a single landscape
painting.”</p>
<p>Akari sat in the driver’s seat of the electric car that was Lua,
wearing clothes that were a transformed Shizuku. Izumi sat in the
passenger seat, watching the passing scenery with eyes full of
curiosity. This visit was more than a simple exchange; it was an
important ritual between the shrines.</p>
<p>The Shrine of Time was nestled deep in the mountains beside a
mist-shrouded lake. As they neared the entrance, Lua’s body—the car—felt
a subtle tremor. A strange sensation, as if time itself were expanding
and contracting, enveloped her. Lua’s avatar took a deep breath and
stepped out of the car.</p>
<p>The shrine gates opened, and a group of maidens welcomed them. Their
eyes were deep and distant, their gaze profound, as if memories of the
past and visions of the future were mingled within. Like the maidens of
their own shrine, they never aged, but their very existence seemed to
stand outside the flow of time.</p>
<p>Lua handed over the Great Maiden’s letter. The maiden who received it
nodded as if she already knew its contents without opening the
envelope.</p>
<p>“Welcome, guardians of the material boundary. We have already
received the Great Maiden’s message.”</p>
<p>Lua could not hide her surprise at the maiden’s words. They truly
seemed to perceive all of time at once.</p>
<p>Lua, Akari, and Izumi were guided inside the shrine. While their own
shrine’s building was the Great Maiden’s body, the buildings here
possessed a stillness, as if the flow of time itself had stopped within
them. In the corridors, one could almost imagine seeing faint shadows of
the past overlapping with afterimages of the future.</p>
<p>They came face to face with the head of this shrine, the ‘Temporal
Guardian.’ The Temporal Guardian, with an androgynous face that was
neither old nor young, welcomed them.</p>
<p>“What you seek to know is the future, I presume. However, the flow of
time cannot be altered carelessly, and to reveal everything would only
invite chaos.”</p>
<p>The Temporal Guardian spoke softly.</p>
<p>“We can see all that the future holds, but we can only convey what is
necessary, when it is necessary. For just as your shrine’s secrets must
be protected, our foresight is also the will of the Divine and must be
guarded.”</p>
<p>After a moment’s hesitation, Lua asked carefully.</p>
<p>“Is there… any great danger approaching our shrine in the
future?”</p>
<p>The Temporal Guardian fell silent. Her gaze seemed to fix upon the
far reaches of time. Then she answered briefly.</p>
<p>“A period of great turmoil is approaching. A time will come when your
shrine’s abilities will be tested. But… I cannot tell you when. I can
only say that you have sufficient time to prepare.”</p>
<p>The answer was clear, yet limited. Lua was disappointed but
understood. Just as her own shrine forbade entry to outsiders to protect
its secrets, this place, too, must have its own strict rules to protect
the flow of time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lua found hope. Even if she could not prevent the
coming danger, the fact that they had time to prepare for it was a great
comfort. After receiving a reply to the Great Maiden’s letter, Lua left
the Shrine of Time and returned home. Their bodies transcended the
limits of matter, but now they carried a new burden: to perceive and
prepare for the approaching future within the flow of
time.<a href="prompts.html#4:4" class="comment-marker">[4:4]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The Shrine of Time, as its name suggested, was a place that
transcended the constraints of time. Its maidens lived perceiving the
past, present, and future simultaneously. Their daily lives appeared
serene on the surface, but they followed a unique rhythm where all
moments of space and time were interwoven.</p>
<p>Mirai, one of the young-looking maidens, but her gaze seemed to see
into the distant future. One day, as Mirai was tending to herbs in the
shrine garden, a hazy vision of the future flashed before her eyes: she
saw herself over-drying the herbs, diminishing their potency.</p>
<p>“Ah, I must remember to keep the herbs in a cool place tomorrow,”
Mirai murmured.</p>
<p>Kako, a veteran maiden watching nearby, smiled. “Avoiding tomorrow’s
mistakes already, are we? As someone who has repeated that same mistake
in the past, I must say I’m envious.”</p>
<p>Kako could not see Mirai’s future, but from her reaction, she knew
Mirai had perceived it. In this way, the temporal maidens didn’t share
their visions directly but would read and react to the flow of the
future through small, everyday actions. Learning from yesterday’s
mistakes and applying tomorrow’s wisdom was simply a part of their daily
life.</p>
<p>In the shrine’s kitchen, peculiar conversations were common. Shiori,
the maiden in charge of the kitchen, always cooked with fresh
ingredients, but her meal plans were driven by more than just present
needs.</p>
<p>“Hmm… the guests arriving in three days prefer meat. I should start
marinating it now,” Shiori would say to herself, trimming a cut of meat
with a translucent blade. She planned meals for guests who had not yet
been invited, or whose invitations were not even confirmed. Days before
Lua’s party visited, Shiori had already foreseen their arrival and their
preferred type of tea, and had made preparations.</p>
<p>“Shiori-san, will we be having fish for dinner tonight? I can see my
future self enjoying delicious steamed fish!” a curious young maiden
named Chie asked as she ran into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Shiori smiled faintly. “Well, if your future memory says so, then of
course I must prepare for it.”</p>
<p>Occasionally, there was communication with the outside
world—delivering a letter from the distant future to the present, or
sending one into the past. These were extremely rare events, however,
and were only undertaken when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>One day, in the deepest part of the Shrine of Time, Ritsu, a maiden
who recorded knowledge of time, was unrolling an ancient scroll. Faint
letters appeared before her eyes: an urgent message recorded by a
scholar hundreds of years in the future, when a great catastrophe had
struck the world.</p>
<p>“This letter must have been delivered to humanity 300 years in the
past. It speaks of the need for specific plant seeds. And the senders…
were the shrine maidens of the future.”</p>
<p>Ritsu rose quietly. She grasped the letter’s contents and identified
the most appropriate moment to send it. This wasn’t changing the past.
It was simply perceiving and acting on a duty in the past, based on a
need from a future that had already happened.</p>
<p>Thus, the maidens of the Shrine of Time lived their intertwined days
of past, present, and future, serving to maintain the harmonious flow of
time. They were the unseen guardians, preserving the temporal balance of
the
world.<a href="prompts.html#4:5" class="comment-marker">[4:5]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Returning from the Shrine of Time, Lua, Akari, and Izumi headed for
the Great Maiden’s abode. Shizuku had transformed back into Lua’s
clothes, and Izumi followed quietly, holding Akari’s hand. The Great
Maiden, as if she had been expecting them, was waiting with warm tea
prepared.</p>
<p>“Welcome back. How was the Shrine of Time?”</p>
<p>To the Great Maiden’s question, Lua replied calmly,</p>
<p>“It was astonishing, Great Maiden. The maidens there truly seem to
perceive all of time at once. They knew everything before we even
arrived. But they would only speak of the future in a limited way.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden nodded at Lua’s words.</p>
<p>“That is the most important secret and principle the Shrine of Time
must uphold. Just as your shrine possesses the ability to cross material
boundaries, they have the duty of guarding the flow of time. Revealing
too much of the future can damage the order of time and bring about
chaos.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden took a sip of tea and continued her explanation.</p>
<p>“The temporal maidens do not transform into specific forms as you do.
They are beings who are themselves assimilated with the very pulse of
time. They exist in every ‘moment.’ Past memories, present sensations,
and future premonitions continuously intersect and flow within their
consciousness.”</p>
<p>Akari asked cautiously, “Then… they can’t create physical objects
like we can?”</p>
<p>“That is correct. They do not possess the ability to manipulate
matter. Instead, their bodies carry the very traces of time. For
instance, they might speak ancient knowledge while in the body of a
newborn, or accurately foresee the events of the next moment while in
the body of an elder. Their physical forms are like vessels that reflect
the flow of time.”</p>
<p>Izumi’s eyes sparkled with wonder. “Then do they know what we’re
thinking right now?”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden smiled gently at Izumi. “It’s easier to think of it
this way: they don’t read your ‘thoughts,’ but rather see the ‘future
results’ your thoughts will create. For them, every chain of cause and
effect is already laid out like a single, predetermined painting.”</p>
<p>“You, the corporeal maidens, and the temporal maidens uphold the will
of the Divine in different ways. You are beings who maintain the
material balance of the world and fulfill the needs of the physical
realm, while they are beings who protect the order of time and the flow
of history. Though you have different abilities, your ultimate goal is
the same: to maintain the harmony of this world and to uphold the will
of the Divine.”</p>
<p>The Great Maiden looked at Lua, Akari, and Izumi with a warm
gaze.</p>
<p>“Just as you have deepened your understanding of the Shrine of Time
through this visit, they too will one day come to understand your
shrine’s abilities more deeply. In the coming period of great turmoil,
the powers of your two shrines may need to join together. That is why it
is so important to understand and respect one another.”</p>
<p>Lua nodded. The visit to the Shrine of Time had given her a new
perspective. It was a chance to be reminded that her ability was not
merely for convenience but played a vital role in maintaining the
world’s balance. And with a vague premonition of the ‘period of great
turmoil’ on the horizon, she came to cherish her own shrine, and the
other maidens, more deeply than
ever.<a href="prompts.html#4:6" class="comment-marker">[4:6]</a></p>
